    <h3>A Manifesto on Cassidy's Guiding Principles</h3>
    <p>
        Cassidy is a training platform inspired by the novel <i>Once a Runner</i> and named after its protagonist, Quenton Cassidy.
        <br> <br>
        Every training platform has a unique take on the best ways to think about training.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Strava focuses on the social aspect.</li>
        <li>Runalyze focuses on numerical analysis.</li>
        <li>Sites like Final Surge and Training Peaks also provide analysis, by also have strengths that relate coaches and athletes.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Each of these have their strengths and weaknesses. Cassidy seeks to fill a slighly different niche.</p>
    <p>
        As in the thesis of <i>Once a Runner</i>, the guiding principle of Cassidy is that hardwork and dedication are the things that make better athletes.
        It's true that complex workout analysis, TRIMP, V02 Max, Lactate Threshold, and a whole host of physiological measures are all interesting and provide insight.
        However, the truth is that training is far more simple than sport physiologists would like to believe.
        All too often, we seek the 1% improvement or spend time fretting over which heartrate zone most of the run was spent in, all at the expense real development.

        With that being said, don't expect many fancy features or analysis tools.
        Cassidy takes the opinionated stance that these kinds of things detract and distract from what training is about.
        What matters is <i>"the trial of miles, miles of trials"</i>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Separate from training principles, Cassidy's other main goal is to provide a way to return data ownership to users.
      This is ultimately a much longer term vision for the project as a whole.

      True data ownership will only be accomplished in a meaningful way when users can choose where their fitness tracking devices sync to.
      That is, Garmin devices (or any other brand), should not have to go through Garmin's servers to sync data with Strava (or any other platform).
      It should be up to the users.

                Cassidy is, in some sense, a continuation of my (personal) development towards a minimalism-like approach to training.
                I've used platforms like Strava, Runalyze and Final Surge.
                They all work well, but overtime I found myself increasingly wanting something different.
                Strava has slowly been locking its features away behind a paywall that I just am not willing to pay for.
                I appreciated Runalyze for a while, but as I've mentioned, I no longer think that heavy numerical analysis really helps all that much.
                Moreover, I wanted something a bit more intuitive to use.
                Finally, Final Surge comes the closest to the thing that I imagine the perfect training platform would look like.
                To that end, those familiar with Final Surge will see lots of similarities, and in many cases I take inspiration directly from it.
                For example, Cassidy's training calendar is identical in many ways to the Final Surge Calendar.
                If my current trajectory continues, I'll probably return to a simple pen and paper training log. But for now, I think Cassidy is the next step to simplification.
                (Note that Final Surge also provides a set of coach-athlete features that I have no interest in replicating)
                <br><br>
                On the topic of data ownership, my own hope is that eventually, anyone who wants to will be able to sync their personal wearables directly to any platform of their choosing.
                Toward this end, I hope that I can slowly develop Cassidy to be a local intermediary between wearables and other platforms (as well as a platform in its own right).
                At first, this is going to look like simple integrations with platforms like Strava.
                But ultimately, I have this (perhaps naive) dream that I will be able to sync my watch directly to Cassidy (and my personal computer), entirely circumventing the need for other servers.
                It's my belief that Garmin, Coros, Suunto, Polar et al. should be primarly watch companies and not data distributors.
                That task should fall to users who can decide where their data goes (and if they so choose, it can go to the watch companies' servers).
